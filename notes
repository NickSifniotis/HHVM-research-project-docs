Backup tracer (?)
within heap_collect.c:

The class PtrMap is used to store and check the existance of stored pointers.
insert stores the Header pointer in the map
contains returns the pointer if it's in the map or nullptr otherwise


The class Marker implements mark/sweep
Marker::Sweep implements a lot of assertions and iterates through the heap, but it doesn't seem to do any thing.
